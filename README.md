## Usage

Standard npm-y things: `npm start`, `npm run build`, etc

## Ideas

The overall point of thatchill.com is to experiment with hand crafted web technologies and present them in a way that is explicitly mine. The site is obtuse and meandering while still being accessible and understandable.

### Landing

Landing page is chill and vibey, with a link to the homepage. 404 pages are similar to the landing page, with a link to return to the home page.

### Home

A retro futuristic style interface reminiscent of Nier Automata and Aliens technological design. Has links to different parts of the site.

### Maze

A maze that can be explored. The maze is rendered from a first person perspective as a series of vertical lines that grow and shrink as the user gets closer to and further away from walls.

Uses SVGs as the vertical lines for speed.

Ambient music is played that corresponds to the EQ represented by the height of the vertical lines (ie closer walls on the left of the screen correlate to a louder bass tone)

The maze contains hidden easter eggs of some sort, idk
